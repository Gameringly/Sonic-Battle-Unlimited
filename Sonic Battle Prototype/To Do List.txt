	List of things to be completed for the current scope

	legend:
		⏳️: on going, someone is taking care of it

	SAGE 2024 Scope

		menu:
	⏳️		is lacking the new design that was made;
	⏳️		needs it’s title screen;
			network join button needs to lead to a screen to select where to join;
			implement new networking script and menu
			check if instantiates call should be multiplayer spawner instead
			clicking online > join > back > host and going to battle, spawns the character outside the stage;

		The bot might need:
			spamming SET is quite easy to beat the bot with
			add navigator agents to the player attacks so bots can avoid
			maybe other behaviours
		
		camera needs a way to see through objects to show the players
			except if it is intentional to hide the player

		check if there are other animations or collisions that need fixing or to be made;
			upper needs a collider extension
		
		ring toss/throw:
			should cause more damage
			create cap to how far the player can go
			check what happens when the player is close to the ring when moving
			make an arc movement like in the original
			create after images like in the original

		attack needs some visual effect to show they are working
			and a stronger effect to emphasize it

		stages and hubs need textures

		characters should flash when their special is full
			maybe a pulsing transparent sphere effect could do

		create a solution to move the player out of the "infinite lifting camera lock"
		
		input remap tab on the options menu:
			allow joystick input or movement
			create a save system
				check if save system will work as webgl
			save new remaped inputs
			load new inputs map
		
		can't double tap for dash using joystick controller
		
		



	Final Scope
		have some way to save progress
		
		maybe have rings around the stage to collect
			should they appear again after some time?

		add volume control, graphics control, and accessibility on options menu
