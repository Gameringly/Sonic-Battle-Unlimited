Development Topics
	List of things to be completed for the current scope

	SAGE 2024 Scope
		The menu is lacking the new design that was made;

		The menu needs itâ€™s title screen;

		The menu join button needs to lead to a screen to select where to join;

		The bot might need different levels of difficulty and behaviours;
			using spamming SET is quite easy to beat the bot

		Need to figure out why more than two sonics appeared on the stage;
			might be a race condition happening after deleting all bots and spawning another one after
			if so, condition the spawning to a limit, check if there are enough bots already
		
		camera needs a way to see through objects to show the players
			except if it is intentional to hide the player

		The character combo needs to work as intended, by pressing the button instead of holding;

		Not sure if there are other animations or collisions that need fixing or to be made;

		Visual effects needs to be done, probably using Godot's particle system;

		The sound effects, background music and ambient music along with it's controls need to be implemented.
