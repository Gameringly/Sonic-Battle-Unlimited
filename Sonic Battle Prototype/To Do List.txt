		The menu is lacking the new design that was made;

		The menu needs itâ€™s title screen;

		The menu join button needs to lead to a screen to select where to join;
		
		clicking online > join > back > host and going to battle, spawns the character outside the stage;

		The bot might need different levels of difficulty and behaviours;
			spamming SET is quite easy to beat the bot
			add navigator agents to the playerattacks so bots can avoid
		
		camera needs a way to see through objects to show the players
			except if it is intentional to hide the player

		check if there are other animations or collisions that need fixing or to be made;
		
		stages and hubs need textures

		characters should flash when their special is full
			maybe a pulsing transparent sphere effect could do
