Development Topics
	List of things to be completed for the current scope

	SAGE 2024 Scope
		The menu is lacking the new design that was made;

		The menu needs itâ€™s title screen;
		
		The menu join button needs to lead to a screen to select where to join;
		
		clicking online > join > back > host and going to battle, spawns the character outside the stage;

		The bot might need different levels of difficulty and behaviours;
			spamming SET is quite easy to beat the bot
			add navigator agents to the player attacks so bots can avoid
		
		camera needs a way to see through objects to show the players
			except if it is intentional to hide the player

		check if there are other animations or collisions that need fixing or to be made;
			upper needs a collider extension
		
		ring toss attack should cause more damage
		
		ring toss should not displace the character immediately to the ring position
			go towards it
			
		dash could leave after images behind

		attack needs some visual effect to show there are working
			and a stronger effect to emphasize it
		
		healing should not be allowed when walking
			or lock direction while healing
		
		stages and hubs need textures

		characters should flash when their special is full
			maybe a pulsing transparent sphere effect could do

		The sound effects, background music and ambient music along with it's controls need to be implemented.
			new audio for the stage
			attack sound
			hit sound
			healing sound
			dash sound
			shot ability sound
			set ability sound
			pow ability sound



	Final Scope
		have some way to save progress
		
		maybe have rings around the stage to collect
			should they appear again after some time?

		add volume control, graphics control, input remap and accessibility on options menu
